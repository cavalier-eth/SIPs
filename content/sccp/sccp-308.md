# Markets require at least 125% collateralization
minimum_liquidity_ratio =125% 

# minimum deposit time is 24 hours

# Enable USDC as collateral, $1 price, $1m cap, cratio 150%, 101% liquidation, minting disabled
usdc_address = 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913

issuanceRatioD18 = MaxUint256
liquidationRatioD18 = 1.01


# ETH 

 150% ETH,
# Liquidation ratios
USDC = 101% 
120% ETH

caps $20m eth, $20m usdc


# Perps

USDC price = $1

# USDC cap = $1m



## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
